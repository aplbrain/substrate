# 4. Implementing your own Layer

Let's create our own layer to add to the scene. Our layer will be called `PictureLayer`, and we'll use it to render 2D images as planes in our scene.

We'll take advantage of the fact that GitHub stores a link to the profile picture of a user at `https://github.com/{username}.png` to get a photo to include in our scene.

First, create a file called `PictureLayer.js`. We'll want to inherit from `ThreejsLayer`, so begin with this:

```js
import ThreejsLayer from 'substrate/components/ThreejsLayer';

export default class PictureLayer extends ThreejsLayer {

    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }

    requestInit(scene) {
        return;
    }
}
```

So far, we've implemented the `constructor` and the `requestInit` function, which is run once when the layer is first added to the scene.

Let's beef up the requestInit function so that it pulls an image down from the web:

```js
requestInit(scene) {
    // Alias `self` to `this` so that we can access
    // `this` inside callbacks
    let self = this;

    // Import a new THREE texture loader so that we can
    // load things in the PNG file format
    var loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
    loader.load('https://github.com/jhuapl.png', (texture) => {
        texture.magFilter = THREE.NearestFilter;
        texture.minFilter = THREE.NearestFilter;
        // Create a 64x64 plane
        var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.PlaneGeometry(64, 64),
            new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({
                map: texture,
                side: THREE.DoubleSide
            }
        );
        // Set x, y, z position
        mesh.position.set(0, 1, 2);

        // Add this item to the `self.children` array
        this.children.push(mesh);
        scene.add(mesh);
    });
}
```

Nice. Let's take that puppy for a spin!

Go back to your index.jsx and import this file, and then add it to our render layers:

```jsx
import PictureLayer from 'PictureLayer.js';

...

<Visualizer
    ref="mainVisualizer"
    renderLayers={ {
        axis: new ThreejsAxisLayer(),
        pic: new PictureLayer(),
    } }
    cameraDistance={150}
/>
```

Hayyy!
