# Making Your Own Layer
If you haven't worked with substrate before, check out the [Getting Started Tutorial](0).

Now that we have a scene with an AxisLayer in it, let's build our own layer.

## GraphLayer.js

Create a new file in your project called `GraphLayer.js`.

`GraphLayer.js`
```js
import Layer from 'apl-substrate/components/Layer';

export default class GraphLayer extends Layer {
    constructor(opts) {
        super(opts);
    }

    requestInit(scene) {
        // Initialize this layer.
    }
}
```

We've created a new type of Layer with a constructor (ignore it for now) and a `requestInit` function. `requestInit` is called when a Layer is added to a Visualizer, and then never again. You should use this to add items into the scene the first time; there is another function that we'll cover later for modifying existing objects and enabling animation or interaction with your layer.

For more documentation on `Layer`s, check out [the docs](https://jhuapl-boss.github.io/substrate/api/Layer).

## Adding Data

Here's our graph:

```js
{
    nodes: [{x: 10, y: 20, z: 30}, {x: 15, y: 25, z: 35}],
    edges: [[0, 1]]
}
```

Simple! Two nodes, one edge between them. Let's render the nodes as sphere and the edge as a line.

We'll write this in the `requestInit` function, since we don't want to add another copy of the graph on every frame! (You'd notice quickly; your browser would probably crash in a few seconds.)

```js

requestInit(scene) {
    let self = this;

    let graph = {
        nodes: [{x: 10, y: 20, z: 30}, {x: 15, y: 25, z: 35}],
        edges: [[0, 1]]
    };

    graph.nodes.forEach(node => {
        let newSphere = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.SphereGeometry(5, 5, 5),
            new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x550000 })
        );
        newSphere.position.set(node.x, node.y, node.z);
        self.children.append(newSphere);
        self.scene.add(newSphere);
    });

    let edgeGeometry = new THREE.Geometry();
    graph.edges.forEach(edge => {
        let start = graph.nodes[edge[0]];
        let stop = graph.nodes[edge[1]];
        edgeGeometry.vertices.push(
            new THREE.Vector3(start.x, start.y, start.z)
        );
        edgeGeometry.vertices.push(
            new THREE.Vector3(stop.x, stop.y, stop.z)
        );
    });
    let edges = new THREE.Line(
        edgeGeometry,
        new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({
            color: 0x00ffff
        })
    );
    self.children.append(edges);
    scene.add(edges);
}
```
