# Making Your Own Layer
If you haven't worked with substrate before, check out the [Getting Started Tutorial](0).

Now that we have a scene with an AxisLayer in it, let's build our own layer.

## GraphLayer.js

Create a new file in your project called `GraphLayer.js`.

`GraphLayer.js`
```js
import Layer from 'apl-substrate/components/Layer';

export default class GraphLayer extends Layer {
    constructor(opts) {
        super(opts);
    }
    
    requestInit() {
        // Initialize this layer.
    }
}
```

We've created a new type of Layer with a constructor (ignore it for now) and a `requestInit` function. `requestInit` is called when a Layer is added to a Visualizer, and then never again. You should use this to add items into the scene the first time; there is another function that we'll cover later for modifying existing objects and enabling animation or interaction with your layer.

For more documentation on `Layer`s, check out [the docs](https://jhuapl-boss.github.io/substrate/api/Layer).
