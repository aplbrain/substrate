# 2. Running your app

## Install webpack
```
npm install --global webpack
```

## Run webpack
Do this every time you update code (or you can configure webpack to `--watch` your code for changes):

```shell
$ webpack index.js bundle.js
```

## Run the server
Now run an http server from this directory.

```shell
$ npm install --global http-server
$ http-server
```

OR:

```shell
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Now, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see your app up and running.
