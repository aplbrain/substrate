# Getting Started
Here's a quick spin-up tutorial to get you ready to use substrate.

## 0. Installing prerequisites
First, you'll want to install prerequisites for your system.


Further node installation instructions are available [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

### OS X
```
brew install node
```

### Windows
Download the installer from [the node website](http://nodejs.org/#download).

### Ubuntu / Debian
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

### Everybody, all together now!

We'll use eslint to keep our files tidy, and we'll use `http-server` to actually serve our content locally. (Eventually, we'll do this with a proper web-server, but for now, this'll do.)
```
npm install --global eslint http-server
```
